### If you are using Eclipse: 
- Run command: "mvn eclipse:eclipse" to generate Eclipse's project files
- Set your output path to "target/classes"

### If you are using IntelliJ: 

- Set your output path to "target/classes"
- Import the project's pom file
- Intellij will not auto-compile when you are running any example, so you have to choose either:
 - Run the examples inside IntelliJ then you have to compile the class manually with (Alt+B E)
 - Run the examples outside IntelliJ with the run_example*.bat
